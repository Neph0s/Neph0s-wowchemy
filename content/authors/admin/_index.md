Xintao Wang (王鑫涛) is a fourth year Ph.D candidate at Fudan University in the School of Computer Science. He is deeply fascinated with ACG (Anime, Comics & Games) culture, and is devoted to revolutionizing the ACG industry with AI techniques. Hence, his research interests primarily focus on  *human-like generative agents and their personas*, including (but not limited to):

1. **Role-Playing Language Agents**: Targeting at creating AI agents that faithfully represent specific personas, including: (1) Accurate and nuanced evaluation of LLMs' role-playing abilities; (2) Construction of high-quality persona datasets from established fictions; (3) Development of foundation models for advanced role-playing abilities; (4) Agent frameworks and applications for role-playing, such as multi-agent systems for creative storytelling.

2. **Cognitive Modeling in Language Models**: Focusing on integrating anthropomorphic cognition into LLMs, such as ego-awareness, social intelligence, personalities, etc. The goal is to promote LLMs’ understanding of the inner world of themselves and others, hence enabling them to generate more cognitively-aligned and human-like responses.
