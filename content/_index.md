       * ***Apr. 2024***:  The first [Survey on Role-Playing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18231) is out! Dive into our comprehensive survey of RPLA technologies, their applications, and the exciting potential for human-AI coexistence. Understanding role-playing paves the way for both personalized assistants and multi-agent society. Check our latest survey on role-playing agent!
       * ***Apr. 2024***:  Check out [SurveyAgent](https://survey-agent.github.io/)! This system stands out by offering a unified platform that supports researchers through various stages of their literature review process, facilitated by a conversational interface that prioritizes user interaction and personalization! Access via homepage and have fun!
       * ***Feb. 2024***:  Check out [InCharacter](https://incharacter.github.io/)! Self-assessments on RPAs are inherently flawed - which heavily depends on LLM’s own understanding of Personality. Instead, our work revolves around interviewing characters in 14 different psychological scales, providing a more objective description of LLM’s role play abilities. Check out this project [demo](https://incharacter.theirstory.cn/)!
