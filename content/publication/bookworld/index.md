abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled social simulation through multi-agent systems. Prior efforts focus on agent societies created from scratch, assigning agents with newly defined personas. However, simulating established fictional worlds and characters remain largely underexplored, despite its significant practical value. In this paper, we introduce BookWorld, a comprehensive system for constructing and simulating book-based multi-agent societies. BookWorld's design covers comprehensive real-world intricacies, including diverse and dynamic characters, fictional worldviews, geographical constraints and changes, e.t.c. BookWorld enables diverse applications including story generation, interactive games and social simulation, offering novel ways to extend and explore beloved fictional works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BookWorld generates creative, high-quality stories while maintaining fidelity to the source books, surpassing previous methods with a win rate of 75.36%. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: |
  “Now we know that we are living our lives in a book.”

  “If what you say is true, I’m going to run away from the book and go my own way.”

  In BookWorld, we create multi-agent societies for characters from fictional books, enabling them to engage in dynamic interactions that transcend their original narratives, thereby crafting innovative storytelling.
